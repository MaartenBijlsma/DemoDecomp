# I never really thought of the Kitagawa method as generalizable until now. Here goes:

#kitagawa <- function(func, pars1, pars2){
#	
#}
## hmm oh ya this one assumes we have equal-length vectors of arguments, 
# in the first instance two vectors of args, but Das Gupta generalized up to 5 or 6 vectors.
# Would be nice to generalize to N vectors. Still the method would only be useful for functions
# only consisting in equal-length vectors of arguments, no other solitary parameters. 

# so in a sense, func() would want to take a single matrix as its argument rather than a vector.
# that way the number of parameters is at least established in a general way.
