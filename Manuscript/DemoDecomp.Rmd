## Abstract

### Background 
Most demographic indices are functions of parameters, such as age-structured rates. There are many case-specific methods to decompose differences in indices to differences in parameters, but only a few general methods exist. 

### Objective
We aim to demonstrate the use of two general decomposition methods available in the `R` package`DemoDecomp`. 

### Methods
Two methods are demonstrated: pseudo-continuous decomposition (`horiuchi()`) and stepwise replacement decomposition  (`stepwise_replacement()`) .

### Results

### Conclusions

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
